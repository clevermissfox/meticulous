            After my cervical spinal fusion in 2014, I feared I would have to
            retire from my career as a nail technician. I decided that if I
            wasnâ€™t able to work, I would live vicariously through others by
            sharing my knowledge so they could provide the same quality services
            to others.

            pedicure and manicure knowledge with the world.

            As my channel began to grow, I simultaneously put energy into
            developing a hand rest for nails in hopes it would save my career.
            After building the hand rest in my garage, various modifications,
            patent prep + submission, I finally received my USPTO patent on{" "}

            I support the education, growth, and collaboration of nail
            technicians and nail lovers all over the world through tutorials. I
            hope to enrich perception and attitudes to create connections
            between nail tech and clients, by teaching there is more to this
            industry than just doing nails.
