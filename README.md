# React + Vite- Meticulous Manicurist Makeover

## Notes

rework css for reusable grid. not sure why i made a container for the grid on the shop page but will be reusing the same kind of template for classes page with categories. one differentce is the minmax will be different so custom property that i can change across pages for a reusable auto-fit grid? the card layout will be different on classes page. ive also messed up the layout on the shop page for the ellipses button.

need the button for triggering dropdown to have the same styles as the other ntop level nav items if that dropdown has [aria-current=page]

took of the padding on the header on small screens but now that it has a bg i need to not.
